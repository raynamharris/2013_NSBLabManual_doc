## Objective
This laboratory manual was created in the spring of 2013 for use in the Integrative Molecular Neuroethology Module of the  Neural Systems & Behavior Course at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The objective was to teach quantitative real time PCR and immunohistochemistry techniques in one week and then have students conduct independent research projectes in the second week.
